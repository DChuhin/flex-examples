# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Simple create-react-app project to demo possible layout option provided with flexbox. Flexbox wrapped into react components with generic abstraction to add examples fast. Just add new example in constants.ts and provide new css file with new example styles.
